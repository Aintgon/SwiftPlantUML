# Security Policy

Policy was purely created to comply to [CII Best Practices Badging program](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge).

Due to the nature of `SwiftPlantUML` no security vulnerabilities are to be expected. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reach out to me through direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger) 

## Supported Versions

Should there be any reason to publish security updates then those would be appled to the `main` branch.
